# Chat Server Multithreading 💬

This is a back-end project. A Chat Server Multithreading, that runs on terminal.
The project made me understand better some important concepts:
* Server side
* Client side
* Socket (Server socket and Client Socket)
* I/O

The server can handle with multiple users at the same time using threading. 👨‍💻 👩🏼‍💻


**NOTE:** Project in master branch
